- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yehoslav. I'm an engineering student from Moldova. I did coding just for fun, but now I think of integrating it into my career.
- 👀 I’m interested in discovering the IT world (no specific preferences).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming, having fun with different languages. Generally Python and Web development are the one that get most attention, but Clojure and Haskell is not far behind.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate.
- 📫 If you really want you can reach me on telegram @yehoslavr.
